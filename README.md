House Price Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The prediction is done using machine learning techniques and a dataset containing historical information about house prices.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd house-price-prediction
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Make predictions on new data:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input new_data.csv
Explore the Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Data
The dataset used for this project is available in the data directory. The main file is house_prices.csv, containing information about house features and their corresponding prices.

Model Training
The model training process is documented in the train_model.ipynb Jupyter notebook. You can explore the steps involved in preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Detailed information is available in the evaluation section of the train_model.ipynb notebook.

Results
The final trained model is saved in the models directory. You can use it to make predictions on new data.
