# House Price Prediction Project üè°üí∞
## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The prediction is done using machine learning techniques and a dataset containing historical information about house prices.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd house-price-prediction`

3. Install the required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Make predictions on new data:
`python predict.py --input new_data.csv`

Explore the Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development:
`jupyter notebook`
## Data
The dataset used for this project is available in the data directory. The main file is house_prices.csv, containing information about house features and their corresponding prices.

## Model Training
The model training process is documented in the train_model.ipynb Jupyter notebook. You can explore the steps involved in preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Detailed information is available in the evaluation section of the train_model.ipynb notebook.

## Results
The final trained model is saved in the models directory. You can use it to make predictions on new data.
